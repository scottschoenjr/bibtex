	abstract = {The ability of ultrasonically-induced oscillations of circulating microbubbles to permeabilize vascular barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) holds great promise for noninvasive targeted drug delivery. A major issue has been a lack of control over the procedure to ensure both safe and effective treatment. Here, we evaluated the use of passively-recorded acoustic emissions as a means to achieve this control. An acoustic emissions monitoring system was constructed and integrated into a clinical transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound system. Recordings were analyzed using a spectroscopic method that isolates the acoustic emissions caused by the microbubbles during sonication. This analysis characterized and quantified harmonic oscillations that occur when the BBB is disrupted, and broadband emissions that occur when tissue damage occurs. After validating the system's performance in pilot studies that explored a wide range of exposure levels, the measurements were used to control the ultrasound exposure level during transcranial sonications at 104 volumes over 22 weekly sessions in four macaques. We found that increasing the exposure level until a large harmonic emissions signal was observed was an effective means to ensure BBB disruption without broadband emissions. We had a success rate of 96\% in inducing BBB disruption as measured by in contrast-enhanced MRI, and we detected broadband emissions in less than 0.2\% of the applied bursts. The magnitude of the harmonic emissions signals was significantly (P\${\textbackslash}lt\$0.001) larger for sonications where BBB disruption was detected, and it correlated with BBB permeabilization as indicated by the magnitude of the MRI signal enhancement after MRI contrast administration (\$R{\textasciicircum}2=0.78\$). Overall, the results indicate that harmonic emissions can be a used to control focused ultrasound-induced BBB disruption. These results are promising for clinical translation of this technology.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is a widely used clinical imaging modality that offers penetration depths in tissue of {\textgreater}10 cm. However, the spatial resolution in US imaging is fundamentally limited by diffraction to approximately half the wavelength of the sound wave employed. The spatial resolution of optical microscopy is limited by the same fundamental physics, but in recent years super-resolution imaging techniques have been developed that overcome the diffraction limit through the localization of many spatially separated photo-switchable or photo-activatable fluorophores. In this paper, we apply a related approach to demonstrate super-resolution imaging with US. We imaged dilute suspensions of microbubble contrast agents flowing through narrow tube-based phantoms. By spatially localizing multiple spatially isolated microbubbles, we constructed super-resolved microbubble location density maps that clearly resolve features 5.1–2.2 times smaller than the US system point spread function full width half maximum in the lateral and axial directions respectively. Our initial characterization experiment using a fixed 100 µm diameter brass wire and a US frequency of 2 MHz suggests that for an ideal stationary point scatterer the ultimate resolution of the unmodified clinical US system used could be in the range of 2–4 µm.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade. In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents—inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.},

METHODS: Emissions from single bubbles within a tube phantom were mapped through an ex vivo human skull using a sparse hemispherical receiver array and a passive beamforming algorithm. Noninvasive phase and amplitude correction techniques were applied to compensate for the aberrating effects of the skull bone. The positions of the individual bubbles were estimated beyond the diffraction limit of ultrasound to produce a super-resolution image of the tube phantom, which was compared with microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).
RESULTS: The resulting super-resolution ultrasound image is comparable to results obtained via the micro-CT for small tissue specimen imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: This method provides superior resolution to deep-tissue contrast ultrasound and has the potential to be extended to provide complete vascular network imaging in the brain.},

In this work, we use a standard clinical US system to perform in vivo sub-diffraction imaging on a CD1, female mouse aged eight weeks by localizing isolated US signals from microbubbles flowing within the ear microvasculature, and compare our results to optical microscopy. Furthermore, we develop a new technique to map blood velocity at super-resolution by tracking individual bubbles through the vasculature. Resolution is improved from a measured lateral and axial resolution of 112 μm and 94 μm respectively in original US data, to super-resolved images of microvasculature where vessel features as fine as 19 μm are clearly visualized. Velocity maps clearly distinguish opposing flow direction and separated speed distributions in adjacent vessels, thereby enabling further differentiation between vessels otherwise not spatially separated in the image. This technique overcomes the diffraction limit to provide a noninvasive means of imaging the microvasculature at super-resolution, to depths of many centimeters. In the future, this method could noninvasively image pathological or therapeutic changes in the microvasculature at centimeter depths in vivo.},

	abstract = {A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term "SR image reconstruction" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term "super" in "super resolution" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.},

However, these techniques are currently limited by low temporal resolution and long acquisition times. Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a fluorescence microscopy technique enabling sub-diffraction limit imaging with high temporal resolution by calculating high order statistics of the fluctuating optical signal. The aim of this work is to achieve fast acoustic imaging with enhanced resolution by applying the tools used in SOFI to contrast-enhance ultrasound (CEUS) plane-wave scans. The proposed method was tested using numerical simulations and evaluated using two in-vivo rabbit models: scans of healthy kidneys and VX-2 tumor xenografts. Improved spatial resolution was observed with a reduction of up to 50\% in the full width half max of the point spread function. In addition, substantial reduction in the background level was achieved compared to standard mean amplitude persistence images, revealing small vascular structures within tumors. The scan duration of the proposed method is less than a second while current super-localization techniques require acquisition duration of several minutes. As a result, the proposed technique may be used to obtain scans with enhanced spatial resolution and high temporal resolution, facilitating flow-dynamics monitoring. Our method can also be applied during a breath-hold, reducing the sensitivity to motion artifacts.},

	abstract = {Far-field optical microscopy using focused light is an important tool in a number of scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio)physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of ‘super-resolution’ far-field optical microscopy (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all in one way or another addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant impact.

Applications of time reversal mirrors (TRMs) in hydrodynamics are then presented in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the application of TRMs in pulse echo detection. A complete theory of the iterative time reversal mode is presented. It will be explained how this technique allows for focusing on different targets in a multi-target medium. Another application of pulse echo TRMs is presented in this section: how to achieve resonance in an elastic target?

	abstract = {As in other imaging methods based on waves, the resolution of ultrasound imaging is limited by the wavelength. However, the diffraction-limit can be overcome by super-localizing single events from isolated sources. In recent years, we developed plane-wave ultrasound allowing frame rates up to 20 000 fps. Ultrafast processes such as rapid movement or disruption of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) can thus be monitored, providing us with distinct punctual sources that could be localized beyond the diffraction limit. We previously showed experimentally that resolutions beyond λ /10 can be reached in ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy (uULM) using a 128 transducer matrix in reception. Higher resolutions are theoretically achievable and the aim of this study is to predict the maximum resolution in uULM with respect to acquisition parameters (frequency, transducer geometry, sampling electronics). The accuracy of uULM is the error on the localization of a bubble, considered a point-source in a homogeneous medium. The proposed model consists in two steps: determining the timing accuracy of the microbubble echo in radiofrequency data, then transferring this time accuracy into spatial accuracy. The simplified model predicts a maximum resolution of 40 μ m for a 1.75 MHz transducer matrix composed of two rows of 64 elements. Experimental confirmation of the model was performed by flowing microbubbles within a 60 μ m microfluidic channel and localizing their blinking under ultrafast imaging (500 Hz frame rate). The experimental resolution, determined as the standard deviation in the positioning of the microbubbles, was predicted within 6 μ m (13\%) of the theoretical values and followed the analytical relationship with respect to the number of elements and depth. Understanding the underlying physical principles determining the resolution of superlocalization will allow the optimization of the imaging setup for each organ. Ultimately, accuracies better than the size of capillaries are achievable at several centimeter depths.},

This work explores the available bubble detection techniques for super-resolution of tumour microvasculature. Pulse inversion (PI), differential imaging (DI) and singular value decomposition (SVD) filtering were compared in terms of the localisation accuracy, precision and contrast to tissue ratio (CTR). Bubble responses were simulated using the Marmottant model. Non-linear propagation through moving and stationary tissue was modelled using k-Wave. The results showed that PI signal was largely independent of flow direction and speed compared to SVD and DI which were less appropriate for lateral motion. At the lowest speeds, the bubble displacement between frames is not sufficient to generate a strong differential signal. SVD is unsuitable for stationary bubbles. For super-resolution of tumour microvasculature, the results suggest that non-linear techniques are preferential.},

	abstract = {Biological structures span many orders of magnitude in size, but far-field visible light microscopy suffers from limited resolution. A new method for fluorescence imaging has been developed that can obtain spatial distributions of large numbers of fluorescent molecules on length scales shorter than the classical diffraction limit. Fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) analyzes thousands of single fluorophores per acquisition, localizing small numbers of them at a time, at low excitation intensity. To control the number of visible fluorophores in the field of view and ensure that optically active molecules are separated by much more than the width of the point spread function, photoactivatable fluorescent molecules are used, in this case the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP). For these photoactivatable molecules, the activation rate is controlled by the activation illumination intensity; nonfluorescent inactive molecules are activated by a high-frequency (405-nm) laser and are then fluorescent when excited at a lower frequency. The fluorescence is imaged by a CCD camera, and then the molecules are either reversibly inactivated or irreversibly photobleached to remove them from the field of view. The rate of photobleaching is controlled by the intensity of the laser used to excite the fluorescence, in this case an Ar+ ion laser. Because only a small number of molecules are visible at a given time, their positions can be determined precisely; with only ∼100 detected photons per molecule, the localization precision can be as much as 10-fold better than the resolution, depending on background levels. Heterogeneities on length scales of the order of tens of nanometers are observed by FPALM of PA-GFP on glass. FPALM images are compared with images of the same molecules by widefield fluorescence. FPALM images of PA-GFP on a terraced sapphire crystal surface were compared with atomic force microscopy and show that the full width at half-maximum of features ∼86 ± 4 nm is significantly better than the expected diffraction-limited optical resolution. The number of fluorescent molecules and their brightness distribution have also been determined using FPALM. This new method suggests a means to address a significant number of biological questions that had previously been limited by microscope resolution.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theory for ultrasonic B-scan image formation. Our theory is based on the assumption that imaging is done using broad-band signals and that all the information in the returned echos is utilized for image formation, as opposed to only the “video” detected envelopes. We also assume that the image is formed from the backscattered returns caused by inhomogeneities within soft tissue structures. In other words, we do not take into account the contributions from the specularly reflecting surfaces that represent large impedance discontinuities. (Surfaces that only represent small impedance changes and are “visible” to the transducer are accounted for by our theory.) Our main reason for this omission is the fact that although the contributions of the surfaces with large impedance changes are important to the delineation of features in some B-scan images, it is the presentation of the backscattered echos from small inhomogeneities within the tissues that is more severely distorted by the radiation and the electromechanical properties of the transducer. Also, it is currently believed that the backscattered echoes from the small inhomogeneities within the tissues carry important pathological information. Our theory is also limited to the case of linearly scanned transducers with unfocused apertures. A major result of our theory is an analytical expression for the point spread function of the image degradation. As expected, this function is position variant. To simplify the computations required for image restoration, we have presented approximations that reduce the point spread function to the position-invariant form. We have shown experimentally that the resulting restoration filters retain their effectiveness over several centimeters of the object thickness. This has led us to conclude that the B-scan images of thick objects may be restored by using piecewise position-invariant techniques.},

This concept has also inspired the emergence of completely novel imaging modes which are valuable for ultrasound-based screening, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring. In this review article, we present the basic principles and implementation of ultrafast imaging.

	abstract = {Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a novel neuroimaging technique, based on high-sensitivity ultrafast Doppler imaging of cerebral blood volume, capable of measuring brain activation and connectivity in rodents with high spatiotemporal resolution (100μm, 1ms). However, the skull attenuates acoustic waves, so fUS in rats currently requires craniotomy or a thinned-skull window. Here we propose a non-invasive approach by enhancing the fUS signal with a contrast agent, inert gas microbubbles. Plane-wave illumination of the brain at high frame rate (500Hz compounded sequence with three tilted plane waves, PRF=1500Hz with a 128 element 15MHz linear transducer), yields highly-resolved neurovascular maps. We compared fUS imaging performance through the intact skull bone (transcranial fUS) versus a thinned-skull window in the same animal. First, we show that the vascular network of the adult rat brain can be imaged transcranially only after a bolus intravenous injection of microbubbles, which leads to a 9dB gain in the contrast-to-tissue ratio. Next, we demonstrate that functional increase in the blood volume of the primary sensory cortex after targeted electrical-evoked stimulations of the sciatic nerve is observable transcranially in presence of contrast agents, with high reproducibility (Pearson's coefficient ρ=0.7±0.1, p=0.85). Our work demonstrates that the combination of ultrafast Doppler imaging and injection of contrast agent allows non-invasive functional brain imaging through the intact skull bone in rats. These results should ease non-invasive longitudinal studies in rodents and open a promising perspective for the adoption of highly resolved fUS approaches for the adult human brain.},

The LANDs can be repeatedly optically triggered to undergo vaporization; the resulting spatially stationary, temporally transient microbubbles provide high ultrasound contrast for several to hundreds of milliseconds before recondensing to their native liquid nanodroplet state. By capturing high frame rate ultrasound images of blinking LANDs, we demonstrate the ability to detect individual recondensation events. Then we apply a newly developed super-resolution image processing algorithm to localize the LAND positions in vivo almost an order of magnitude better than conventional ultrasound imaging.

	abstract = {The concept of the diffraction limit put forth by Ernst Abbe and others has been an important guiding principle limiting our ability to tightly focus classical waves, such as light and sound, in the far field. In the past decade, numerous reports have described focusing or imaging with light and sound "below the diffraction limit". We argue that the diffraction limit defined in a reasonable way, for example in terms of the upper bound on the wave numbers corresponding to the spatial Fourier components of the intensity profile, or in terms of the spot size into which at least 50\% of the incident power can be focused, still stands unbroken to this day. We review experimental observations of "subwavelength" or "sub-diffraction-limit" focusing, which can be principally broken down into three broad categories: (i) "super-resolution", i.e. the technique based on the modification of the pupil of the optical system to reduce the width of the central maximum in the intensity distribution at the expense of increasing side bands; (ii) solid immersion lenses, making use of metamaterials with a high effective index; (iii) concentration of intensity by a subwavelength structure such as an antenna. Even though a lot of interesting work has been done along these lines, none of the hitherto performed experiments violated the sensibly defined diffraction limit.},

	abstract = {Delay estimation is used in ultrasonic imaging to estimate blood or soft tissue motion, to measure echo arrival time differences for phase aberration correction, and to estimate displacement for tissue elasticity measurements. In each of these applications delay estimation is performed using speckle signals which are at least partially decorrelated relative to one another. Delay estimates which utilize such data are subject to large errors known as false peaks and smaller magnitude errors known as jitter. While false peaks can sometimes be removed through nonlinear processing, jitter errors place a fundamental limit on the performance of delay estimation techniques. The authors apply the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound to derive an analytical expression which predicts the magnitude of jitter errors incurred when estimating delays using radio frequency (RF) data from speckle targets. The analytical expression presented includes the effects of signal decorrelation due to physical processes, corruption by electronic noise, and a number of other factors. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of the normalized cross correlation algorithm closely matches theoretical predictions. These results indicate that for poor signal to noise ratios (0 dB) a small improvement in signal to noise ratio can dramatically reduce jitter magnitude. At high signal to noise ratios (30 dB) small amounts of signal decorrelation can significantly increase the magnitude of jitter errors.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

In this Letter, taking inspiration from super-resolution imaging techniques developed to beat the optical diffraction limit, we demonstrate that the localization of individual optical absorbers can provide super-resolution photoacoustic imaging well beyond the acoustic diffraction limit. As a proof-of-principle experiment, photoacoustic cross-sectional images of microfluidic channels were obtained with a 15 MHz linear capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer array, while absorbing beads were flown through the channels. The localization of individual absorbers allowed us to obtain a super-resolved cross-sectional image of the channels by reconstructing both the channel width and position with an accuracy better than λ/10. Given the discrete nature of endogenous absorbers such as red blood cells, or that of exogenous particular contrast agents, localization is a promising approach to push the current resolution limits of photoacoustic imaging.},

Several super-resolution methods have been developed over the last decade, all capable of overcoming the fundamental diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining subdiffraction limit optical resolution in all three dimensions. This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded in a sequence of images (movie). We demonstrate a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope. This resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps, which in turn allows the evaluation of images at different resolution levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method features significant background reduction and thus contrast enhancement and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of fibroblast cells.},

	abstract = {This report describes the development of an experimental system for ultrasound computed tomography and its application to breast imaging. Details of the system design and methods of high-speed data acquisition are presented. The method uses low-power discrete frequency sound in the range of 0.3–1.2 MHz, two cylindrical arrays of 512 and 1024 PZT transducers, high spatial sampling of the wavefront, and unique diffraction tomographic reconstruction methods. One transducer at a time is activated and allowed to reach steady state at which point the remaining measure phase and amplitude of the ultrasound signal. A total of 64 MB of data are acquired in {\textless}1 s for the 512-element array and 128 MB in {\textless}3 s for the 1024 array. Several algorithms have been developed to produce the diffraction tomogram which is reconstructed as either a 512 × 512 or 1024 × 1024 matrix of the scattering potential of the object dependent on speed of sound and attenuation. The effects of aberration are greatly diminished by a hybrid iterative algorithm. To date, human images have been made of the female breast which show good depiction of glandular structures and differentiation of gland and fat, and the coronal format provides a novel of the entire breast in life-size display. The results demonstrate that the technique provides a unique quantitative ultrasound image with high resolution over a very large global field of view of the breast. The method shows promise for improved imaging of the breast. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Imaging Syst Technol, 8: 137–147, 1997},

	abstract = {Super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging with contrast microbubbles has recently been proposed by multiple studies, demonstrating outstanding resolution with high potential for clinical applications. This paper aims at addressing the potential noise issue in in vivo human super-resolution imaging with ultrafast plane-wave imaging. The rich spatiotemporal information provided by ultrafast imaging presents features that allow microbubble signals to be separated from background noise. In addition, the high-frame-rate recording of microbubble data enables the implementation of robust tracking algorithms commonly used in particle tracking velocimetry. In this paper, we applied the nonlocal means (NLM) denoising filter on the spatiotemporal domain of the microbubble data to preserve the microbubble tracks caused by microbubble movement and suppress random background noise. We then implemented a bipartite graph-based pairing method with the use of persistence control to further improve the microbubble signal quality and microbubble tracking fidelity. In an in vivo rabbit kidney perfusion study, the NLM filter showed effective noise rejection and substantially improved microbubble localization. The bipartite graph pairing and persistence control demonstrated further noise reduction, improved microvessel delineation, and a more consistent microvessel blood flow speed measurement. With the proposed methods and freehand scanning on a free-breathing rabbit, a single microvessel cross-sectional profile with full-width at half-maximum of 57 μm could be imaged at approximately 2-cm depth (ultrasound transmit center frequency = 8 MHz, theoretical spatial resolution 200 μm). Cortical microvessels that are 76 μm apart can also be clearly separated. These results suggest that the proposed methods have good potential in facilitating robust in vivo clinical super-resolution microvessel imaging.},

	abstract = {The imaging of microvessels and the quantification of their blood flow is of particular interest in the characterization of tumor vasculature. The imaging resolution (50-200 μm) of highfrequency ultrasound (US) (20-50 MHz) is not sufficient to image microvessels ( 10 μm) and Doppler sensitivity is not high enough to measure capillary blood flow ( 1 mm/s). For imaging of blood flow in microvessels, our approach is to detect single microbubbles (MBs), track them over several frames, and to estimate their velocity. First, positions of MBs will be detected by separating B-mode frames in a moving foreground and a static background. For the crucial task of association of these positions to tracks, we implemented a modified Markov chain Monte Carlo data association (MCMCDA) algorithm, which can handle a high number of MBs. False alarms, the detection, initiation, and termination of MBs tracks are incorporated in the underlying model. To test the performance of algorithms, a US imaging simulation of a vessel tree with flowing MBs was set up (resolution 148 μm). The trajectories and flow velocity in the vessels with a lateral distance of 100 μm were reconstructed with super-resolution. In a phantom experiment, a suspension of MBs was pumped through a tube (diameter 0.4 mm) at speeds of 2.2, 4.2, 6.3, and 10.5 mm/s and was imaged with a Vevo2100 system (Visualsonics). Estimated mean speeds of the MBs were 2.1, 4.7, 7, and 10.5 mm/s. To demonstrate the applicability for in vivo measurements, a tumor xenograft-bearing mouse was imaged by this approach. The tumor vasculature was visualized with higher resolution than in a maximum intensity persistence image and the velocity values were in the expected range 0-1 mm/s.},

	abstract = {Currently ultrasound resolution is limited by diffraction to approximately half the wavelength of the sound wave employed. In recent years, super resolution imaging techniques have overcome the diffraction limit through the localization and tracking of a sparse set of microbubbles through the vasculature. However, this has only been performed on fixated tissue, limiting its clinical application. This paper proposes a technique for making super resolution images on non-fixated tissue by first compensating for tissue movement and then tracking the individual microbubbles. The experiment is performed on the kidney of a anesthetized Sprage-Dawley rat by infusing SonoVue at 0.1× original concentration. The algorithm demonstrated in vivo that the motion compensation was capable of removing the movement caused by the mechanical ventilator. The results shows that microbubbles were localized with a higher precision, reducing the standard deviation of the super localizations from 22μm to 8 μm. The paper proves that the restriction of completely fixated tissue can be eliminated, when making super resolution imaging with microbubbles.},

Here, we demonstrate the potential of 'ultrasound localization microscopy' applied volumetrically in combination with quantitative analysis of microvascular morphology, as an approach to overcome this limitation. This pilot study demonstrates our ability to image complex microvascular patterns associated with tumor angiogenesis in-vivo at a resolution of tens of microns - substantially better than the diffraction limit of traditional clinical ultrasound, yet using an 8 MHz clinical ultrasound probe. Furthermore, it is observed that data from healthy and tumor-bearing tissue exhibit significant differences in microvascular pattern and density. Results suggests that with continued development of these novel technologies, ultrasound has the potential to detect biomarkers of cancer based on the microvascular 'fingerprint' of malignant angiogenesis rather than through imaging of blood flow dynamics or the tumor mass itself.},

	abstract = {Super-resolution algorithms in ultrasound imaging are attracting the interest of researchers recently due to the ability of these methods to enable enhanced vascular imaging. In this study, two super-resolution imaging methods are compared for post-processing images of microbubbles generated using passive acoustic mapping (PAM) methods with a potential application of three-dimensional brain vascular imaging. The first method is based on fitting single bubble images one at a time with a 3D Gaussian profile to localize the microbubbles and a superresolution image is then formed using the uncertainty of the localization as the standard deviation of the Gaussian profile. The second super-resolution method is based on image deconvolution that processes multiframe resolution-limited images iteratively and estimates the intensity at each pixel of the super-resolution image without the need for localizing each microbubble. The point spread function (PSF) is approximated by a Gaussian curve which is similar to the beam response of the hemispherical transducer array used in our experimental setup. The Cramér-Rao Bounds (CRB) of the two estimation techniques are derived analytically and the performance of these techniques is compared through numerical simulations based on experimental PAM images. For linear and sinusoidal traces, the localization errors between the estimated peaks by the fitting-based method and the actual source locations were 220+/-10 μm and 210+/- 5μm, respectively, as compared to 74 +/-10 μm and 59 +/- 8 μm with the deconvolution-based method. However, in terms of the running time and the computational costs, the curve fitting technique outperforms the deconvolution based approach.},

	abstract = {In the present proof of principle study, we evaluated the homogenous angular spectrum method for passive acoustic mapping (AS-PAM) of microbubble oscillations using simulated and experimental data. In the simulated data we assessed the ability of AS-PAM to form 3D maps of a single and multiple point sources. Then, in the two dimensional limit, we compared the 2D maps from AS-PAM with alternative frequency and time domain passive acoustic mapping (FD- and TD-PAM) approaches. Finally, we assessed the ability of AS-PAM to visualize microbubble activity in vivo with data obtained during 8 different experiments of FUS-induced blood-brain barrier disruption in 3 nonhuman primates, using a clinical MR-guided FUS system. Our in silico results demonstrate AS-PAM can be used to perform 3D passive acoustic mapping. 2D AS-PAM as compared to FD- PAM and TD-PAM is 10 and 200 times faster respectively and has similar sensitivity, resolution, and localization accuracy, even when the noise was 10-fold higher than the signal. In-vivo, the AS-PAM reconstructions of emissions at frequency bands pertinent to the different types of microbubble oscillations were also found to be more sensitive than TD-PAM. AS-PAM of harmonic-only components predicted safe blood-brain barrier disruption, whereas AS-PAM of broadband emissions correctly identified MR-evident tissue damage. The disparity (3.2 mm) in the location of the cavitation activity between the three methods was within their resolution limits. These data clearly demonstrate that AS-PAM is a sensitive and fast approach for PAM, thus providing a clinically relevant method to guide therapeutic ultrasound procedures.},

Different methods have been used to bypass the BBB, but they have limitations such as being invasive, non-targeted or requiring the formulation of new drugs. Focused ultrasound (FUS), when combined with circulating microbubbles, is a noninvasive method to locally and transiently disrupt the BBB at discrete targets. This review provides insight on the current status of this unique drug delivery technique, experience in preclinical models, and potential for clinical translation. If translated to humans, this method would offer a flexible means to target therapeutics to desired points or volumes in the brain, and enable the whole arsenal of drugs in the CNS that are currently prevented by the BBB.},

	abstract = {Acoustic emission was monitored during focused ultrasound exposures in conjunction with an ultrasound contrast agent (Optison) in order to determine if cavitation activity is associated with the induction of blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD). Thirty-four locations were sonicated (frequency: 260 kHz) at targets 10 mm deep in rabbit brain (N = 9). The sonications were applied at peak pressure amplitudes ranging from 0.11 to 0.57 MPa (burst length: 10 ms; repetition frequency of 1 Hz; duration: 20 s). Acoustic emission was recorded with a focused passive cavitation detector. This emission was recorded at each location during sonications with and without Optison. Detectable wideband acoustic emission was observed only at 0.40 and 0.57 MPa. BBBD was observed in contrast MRI after sonication at 0.29-0.57 MPa. The appearance of small regions of extravasated erythrocytes appeared to be associated with this wideband emission signal. The results thus suggest that BBBD resulting from focused ultrasound pulses in the presence of Optison can occur without indicators for inertial cavitation in vivo, wideband emission and extravasation. If inertial cavitation is not responsible for the BBBD, other ultrasound/microbubble interactions are likely the source. A significant increase in the emission signal due to Optison at the second and third harmonics of the ultrasound driving frequency was found to correlate with BBBD and might be useful as an online method to indicate when the disruption occurs.},

Intravital microscopy was employed in conjunction with ultrasound exposure in cremaster muscle of male Wistar rats. Definity® microbubbles were administered intravenously through the tail vein (80 μL.kg-1.min-1infusion rate) with the aid of a syringe pump. For the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) study, exposures were performed at four locations of the cremaster at a PRF of 1000, 500, 100 and 10 Hz (one location per PRF per rat). The 100-pulse exposures were implemented at a peak rarefactional pressure (Pr) of 2 MPa, frequency of 2.25 MHz with 46 cycle pulses. For the pressure amplitude threshold study, 100-pulse exposures (46 cycle pulses) were conducted at various peak rarefactional pressures from 0.5 MPa to 2 MPa at a frequency of 2.25 MHz and PRF of 100 Hz. Photomicrographs were captured before and 2-minutes post exposure. On a pulse-to-pulse basis, the 10 Hz acoustic emission was considerably higher and more sustained than those at other PRFs (1000, 500, and 100 Hz) (p {\textless} 0.05). Damage, measured as area of extravasation of red blood cells (RBC's), was also significantly higher at 10 Hz PRF than at 1000, 500, and 100 Hz (p {\textless} 0.01). The correlation of acoustic emission to tissue damage showed a trend of increasing damage with increasing cumulative function of the relative integrated power spectrum (CRIPS; R2 = 0.75). No visible damage was present at Pr ≤ 0.85 MPa. Damage, however, was observed at Pr ≥ 1.0 MPa, and it increased with increasing acoustic pressure.},

A major issue has been a lack of control over the procedure to ensure both safe and effective treatment. Here, we evaluated the use of passively-recorded acoustic emissions as a means to achieve this control. An acoustic emissions monitoring system was constructed and integrated into a clinical transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound system. Recordings were analyzed using a spectroscopic method that isolates the acoustic emissions caused by the microbubbles during sonication. This analysis characterized and quantified harmonic oscillations that occur when the BBB is disrupted, and broadband emissions that occur when tissue damage occurs. After validating the system's performance in pilot studies that explored a wide range of exposure levels, the measurements were used to control the ultrasound exposure level during transcranial sonications at 104 volumes over 22 weekly sessions in four macaques. We found that increasing the exposure level until a large harmonic emissions signal was observed was an effective means to ensure BBB disruption without broadband emissions. We had a success rate of 96\% in inducing BBB disruption as measured by in contrast-enhanced MRI, and we detected broadband emissions in less than 0.2\% of the applied bursts. The magnitude of the harmonic emissions signals was significantly (P{\textless}0.001) larger for sonications where BBB disruption was detected, and it correlated with BBB permeabilization as indicated by the magnitude of the MRI signal enhancement after MRI contrast administration (R2 = 0.78). Overall, the results indicate that harmonic emissions can be a used to control focused ultrasound-induced BBB disruption. These results are promising for clinical translation of this technology.},

Unlike ultrasound thermal therapies, during which magnetic resonance thermometry can serve as a reliable treatment control modality, real-time control of modulated BBB disruption with undetectable vascular damage remains a challenge. Here a closed-loop cavitation controlling paradigm that sustains stable cavitation while suppressing inertial cavitation behavior was designed and validated using a dual-transducer system operating at the clinically relevant ultrasound frequency of 274.3 kHz. Tests in the normal brain and in the F98 glioma model in vivo demonstrated that this controller enables reliable and damage-free delivery of a predetermined amount of the chemotherapeutic drug (liposomal doxorubicin) into the brain. The maximum concentration level of delivered doxorubicin exceeded levels previously shown (using uncontrolled sonication) to induce tumor regression and improve survival in rat glioma. These results confirmed the ability of the controller to modulate the drug delivery dosage within a therapeutically effective range, while improving safety control. It can be readily implemented clinically and potentially applied to other cavitation-enhanced ultrasound therapies.},

Perfluorocarbon-filled albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs were prepared with a mean diameter of 2320 nm and concentration of 2.903×10 9 MBs ml –1 using albumin-(Gd-DTPA) and by sonication with perfluorocarbon (C 3 F 8 ) gas. The albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs were then centrifuged and the procedure was repeated until the free Gd 3+ ions were eliminated (which were detected by the xylenol orange sodium salt solution). The albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs were also characterized and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo by US and MR imaging. Focused US was used with the albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs to induce disruption of the BBB in 18 rats. BBB disruption was confirmed with contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted turbo-spin-echo sequence MR imaging. Heavy T 2 *-weighted 3D fast low-angle shot sequence MR imaging was used to detect ICH. In vitro US imaging experiments showed that albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs can significantly enhance the US contrast in T 1 -, T 2 - and T 2 *-weighted MR images. The r 1 and r 2 relaxivities for Gd-DTPA were 7.69 and 21.35 s −1 mM −1 , respectively, indicating that the MBs represent a positive contrast agent in T 1 -weighted images. In vivo MR imaging experiments on 18 rats showed that focused US combined with albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs can be used to both induce disruption of the BBB and detect ICH. To compare the signal intensity change between pure BBB opening and BBB opening accompanying ICH, albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MB imaging can provide a ratio of 5.14 with significant difference ( p = 0.026), whereas Gd-DTPA imaging only provides a ratio of 2.13 and without significant difference ( p = 0.108). The results indicate that albumin-(Gd-DTPA) MBs have potential as a US/MR dual-modality contrast agent for BBB opening and differentiating focused-US-induced BBB opening from ICH, and can monitor the focused ultrasound brain drug delivery process.},

Inertial cavitation has been previously shown to result in increased heat deposition and to be associated with broadband noise emissions that can be readily monitored using a passive receiver without interference from the main HIFU signal. In the present study, the signals received passively by each of 64 elements on a standard diagnostic array placed coaxially with the HIFU transducer are combined using time exposure acoustics to generate maps of inertially cavitating regions during HIFU exposure of an agar-based tissue-mimicking material. The technique is shown to be effective in localizing single-bubble activity, as well as contiguous and disjoint cavitating regions instigated by creating regions of lower cavitation threshold within the tissue phantom. The cavitation maps obtained experimentally are also found to be in good agreement with computational simulations and theoretical predictions. Unlike B-mode imaging, which requires interleaving with the HIFU pulse, passive array-based mapping of cavitation activity is possible during HIFU exposure. If cavitating regions can be directly correlated to increased tissue damage, this novel cavitation mapping technique could enable real-time HIFU treatment monitoring.},

Both the Capon beamformer and the robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for PAM are suggested as methods to reduce interference artifacts and improve resolution, which has been one of the experimental issues previously observed with TEA. Simulation results that replicate the experimental artifacts are shown to suggest that bubble interactions are the chief cause. Analysis is provided to show that these multiple bubble artifacts are generally not reduced by TEA, while Capon-based methods are able to reduce the artifacts.

	abstract = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) phased arrays show promise for non-invasive brain therapy. However, the majority of them are limited to a single transmit/receive frequency and therefore lack the versatility to expose and monitor the treatment volume. Multi-frequency arrays could offer variable transmit focal sizes under a fixed aperture, and detect different spectral content on receive for imaging purposes. Here, a three-frequency (306, 612, and 1224 kHz) sparse hemispherical ultrasound phased array (31.8 cm aperture; 128 transducer modules) was constructed and evaluated for microbubble-mediated transcranial therapy and simultaneous cavitation mapping. The array is able to perform effective electronic beam steering over a volume spanning (−40, 40) and (−30, 50) mm in the lateral and axial directions, respectively. The focal size at the geometric center is approximately 0.9 (2.1) mm, 1.7 (3.9) mm, and 3.1 (6.5) mm in lateral (axial) pressure full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1224, 612, and 306 kHz, respectively. The array was also found capable of dual-frequency excitation and simultaneous multi-foci sonication, which enables the future exploration of more complex exposure strategies. Passive acoustic mapping of dilute microbubble clouds demonstrated that the point spread function of the receive array has a lateral (axial) intensity FWHM between 0.8–3.5 mm (1.7–11.7 mm) over a volume spanning (−25, 25) mm in both the lateral and axial directions, depending on the transmit/receive frequency combination and the imaging location. The device enabled both half and second harmonic imaging through the intact skull, which may be useful for improving the contrast-to-tissue ratio or imaging resolution, respectively. Preliminary in vivo experiments demonstrated the system’s ability to induce blood–brain barrier opening and simultaneously spatially map microbubble cavitation activity in a rat model. This work presents a tool to investigate optimal strategies for non-thermal FUS brain therapy and concurrent microbubble cavitation monitoring through the availability of multiple frequencies.},

Recently, techniques have been developed to create images of cavitation activity to provide investigators with a more complete set of information. These techniques use arrays to record and subsequently beamform received cavitation emissions, rather than processing emissions received on a single-element transducer. In this paper, the methods for performing frequency-domain delay, sum, and integrate passive imaging are outlined. The method can be applied to any passively acquired acoustic scattering or emissions, including cavitation emissions. To compare data across different systems, techniques for normalizing Fourier transformed data and converting the data to the acoustic energy received by the array are described.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if focused ultrasound disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be safely controlled by using real-time modulation of treatment pressures on the basis of acoustic emissions from the exposed microbubbles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All experiments were performed with the approval of the institutional animal care committee. Transcranial focused ultrasound (551.5 kHz, 10-msec bursts, 2-Hz pulse repetition frequency, 2 minute sonication) in conjunction with circulating microbubbles was applied in 86 locations in 27 rats to disrupt the BBB. Acoustic emissions captured during each burst by using a wideband polyvinylidene fluoride hydrophone were analyzed for spectral content and used to adjust treatment pressures. Pressures were increased incrementally after each burst until ultraharmonic emissions were detected, at which point the pressure was reduced to a percentage of the pressure required to induce the ultraharmonics and was maintained for the remainder of the sonication. Disruption was evaluated at contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Mean enhancement was calculated by averaging the signal intensity at the focus over a 3 × 3-pixel region of interest and comparing it with that in nonsonicated tissue. Histologic analysis was performed to determine the extent of damage to the tissue. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student t tests.
RESULTS: For sonications resulting in BBB disruption, the mean peak pressure was 0.28 MPa ± 0.05 (standard deviation) (range, 0.18-0.40 MPa). By using the control algorithm, a linear relationship was found between the scaling level and the mean enhancement on T1-weighted MR images after contrast agent injection. At a 50\% scaling level, mean enhancement of 19.6\% ± 1.7 (standard error of the mean) was achieved without inducing damage. At higher scaling levels, histologic analysis revealed gross tissue damage, while at a 50\% scaling level, no damage was observed at high-field-strength MR imaging or histologic examination 8 days after treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acoustic emissions can be used to actively control focused ultrasound exposures for the safe induction of BBB disruption.},

	abstract = {Burst-tone focused ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles has been demonstrated to be effective at inducing temporal and local opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which promises significant clinical potential to deliver therapeutic molecules into the central nervous system (CNS). Traditional contrast-enhanced imaging confirmation after focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure serves as a post-operative indicator of the effectiveness of FUS-BBB opening, however, an indicator that can concurrently report the BBB status and BBB-opening effectiveness is required to provide effective feedback to implement this treatment clinically. In this study, we demonstrate the use of subharmonic acoustic emission detection with implementation on a confocal dual-frequency piezoelectric ceramic structure to perform real-time monitoring of FUS-BBB opening. A confocal dual-frequency (0.55 MHz/1.1 MHz) focused ultrasound transducer was designed. The 1.1 MHz spherically-curved ceramic was employed to deliver FUS exposure to induce BBB-opening, whereas the outer-ring 0.55 MHz ceramic was employed to detect the subharmonic acoustic emissions originating from the target position. In stage-1 experiments, we employed spectral analysis and performed an energy spectrum density (ESD) calculation. An optimized 0.55 MHz ESD level change was shown to effectively discriminate the occurrence of BBB-opening. Wideband acoustic emissions received from 0.55 MHz ceramics were also analyzed to evaluate its correlations with erythrocyte extravasations. In stage-2 real-time monitoring experiments, we applied the predetermined ESD change as a detection threshold in PC-controlled algorithm to predict the FUS exposure intra-operatively. In stage-1 experiment, we showed that subharmonic ESD presents distinguishable dynamics between intact BBB and opened BBB, and therefore a threshold ESD change level (5.5 dB) can be identified for BBB-opening prediction. Using this ESD change threshold detection as a surrogate to on/off control the FUS exposure in stage-2 experiments, we demonstrated both excellent sensitivity (92\%) and specificity (92.3\%) in discriminating BBB-opening occurrence can be obtained in animal treatments, while concurrently achieving a high positive predicted value (95.8\%). Wideband ESD was also highly correlated with the occurrence and level of erythrocyte extravasations ( r 2 = 0.81). The proposed system configuration and corresponding analysis based on subharmonic acoustic emissions has the potential to be implemented as a real-time feedback control structure for reliable indication of intact FUS-BBB opening for CNS brain drug delivery.},

Although acoustic parameters are reproducible in small animals, their control remains challenging in primates due to skull heterogeneity. This study describes a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR)-guided FUS system designed for BBB disruption in non-human primates (NHP) with a robust feedback control based on passive cavitation detection (PCD). Contrast enhanced T1-weighted MR images confirmed the BBB opening in NHP sonicated during 2 min with 500-kHz frequency, pulse length of 10 ms, and pulse repetition frequency of 5 Hz. The safe acoustic pressure range from 185 ± 22 kPa to 266 ± 4 kPa in one representative case was estimated from combining data from the acoustic beam profile with the BBB opening and hemorrhage profiles obtained from MR images. A maximum amount of MR contrast agent at focus was observed at 30 min after sonication with a relative contrast enhancement of 67\% ± 15\% (in comparison to that found in muscles). The feedback control based on PCD using relative spectra was shown to be robust, allowing comparisons across animals and experimental sessions. Finally, we also demonstrated that PCD can test acoustic coupling conditions, which improves the efficacy and safety of ultrasound transmission into the brain.},

	abstract = {The mechanical index (MI) was formulated to gauge the likelihood of adverse bioeffects from inertial cavitation. However, the MI formulation did not consider bubble activity from stable cavitation. This type of bubble activity can be readily nucleated from ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) and has the potential to promote beneficial bioeffects. Here, the presence of stable cavitation is determined numerically by tracking the onset of subharmonic oscillations within a population of bubbles for frequencies up to 7 MHz and peak rarefactional pressures up to 3 MPa. In addition, the acoustic pressure rupture threshold of an UCA population was determined using the Marmottant model. The threshold for subharmonic emissions of optimally sized bubbles was found to be lower than the inertial cavitation threshold for all frequencies studied. The rupture thresholds of optimally sized UCAs were found to be lower than the threshold for subharmonic emissions for either single cycle or steady state acoustic excitations. Because the thresholds of both subharmonic emissions and UCA rupture are linearly dependent on frequency, an index of the form I(CAV) = P(r)/f (where P(r) is the peak rarefactional pressure in MPa and f is the frequency in MHz) was derived to gauge the likelihood of subharmonic emissions due to stable cavitation activity nucleated from UCAs.},

	abstract = {OBJECT Transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) is an emerging noninvasive alternative to surgery and radiosurgery that is undergoing testing for tumor ablation and functional neurosurgery. The method is currently limited to central brain targets due to skull heating and other factors. An alternative ablative approach combines very low intensity ultrasound bursts and an intravenously administered microbubble agent to locally destroy the vasculature. The objective of this work was to investigate whether it is feasible to use this approach at deep brain targets near the skull base in nonhuman primates. METHODS In 4 rhesus macaques, targets near the skull base were ablated using a clinical TcMRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz. Low-duty-cycle ultrasound exposures (sonications) were applied for 5 minutes in conjunction with the ultrasound contrast agent Definity, which was administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion. The acoustic power level was set to be near the inertial cavitation threshold, which was measured using passive monitoring of the acoustic emissions. The resulting tissue effects were investigated with MRI and with histological analysis performed 3 hours to 1 week after sonication. RESULTS Thirteen targets were sonicated in regions next to the optic tract in the 4 animals. Inertial cavitation, indicated by broadband acoustic emissions, occurred at acoustic pressure amplitudes ranging from 340 to 540 kPa. MRI analysis suggested that the lesions had a central region containing red blood cell extravasations that was surrounded by edema. Blood-brain barrier disruption was observed on contrast-enhanced MRI in the lesions and in a surrounding region corresponding to the prefocal area of the FUS system. In histology, lesions consisting of tissue undergoing ischemic necrosis were found in all regions that were sonicated above the inertial cavitation threshold. Tissue damage in prefocal areas was found in several cases, suggesting that in those cases the sonication exceeded the inertial cavitation threshold in the beam path. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to use a clinical TcMRgFUS system to ablate skull base targets in nonhuman primates at time-averaged acoustic power levels at least 2 orders of magnitude below what is needed for thermal ablation with this device. The results point to the risks associated with the method if the exposure levels are not carefully controlled to avoid inertial cavitation in the acoustic beam path. If methods can be developed to provide this control, this nonthermal approach could greatly expand the use of TcMRgFUS for precisely targeted ablation to locations across the entire brain.},

A passive cavitation detection scheme was utilized to measure cavitation thresholds at 120 kHz (80\% duty cycle, 1667 Hz pulse repetition frequency) for four host fluid and sample combinations: plasma, plasma with rt-PA, plasma with clot and plasma with clot and rt-PA. Following cavitation threshold determination, clots were exposed to pulsed ultrasound for 30 min in vitro using three separate ultrasound treatment regimes: (1) no cavitation (0.15 MPa), (2) SC alone (0.24 MPa) or (3) SC + IC combined (0.36 MPa) in the presence of rt-PA. Percent clot mass loss after each treatment was used to determine thrombolysis efficacy. The highest percent mass loss was observed in the stable cavitation regime (26\%), followed by the combined stable and inertial cavitation regime (20.7\%). Interestingly, the percent mass loss in clots exposed to ultrasound without cavitation (13.7\%) was not statistically significantly different from rt-PA alone (13\%) [p {\textgreater} 0.05]. Significant enhancement of thrombolysis correlates with presence of cavitation and stable cavitation appears to play a more important role in the enhancement of thrombolysis. (E-mail: ).},

However, inertial cavitation of microbubbles during FUS-induced BBB opening causes intracerebral hemorrhaging (ICH), leading to acute and chronic brain injury and limiting the efficiency of drug delivery. Here we investigated whether induction of drug (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, BCNU)-loaded bubbles (BCNU bubbles) to oscillate at their resonant frequency would reduce inertial cavitation during BBB opening, thereby eliminating ICH and enhancing drug delivery in a rat brain model. FUS was tested at 1 and 10 MHz, over a wide range of pressure (mechanical index ranging from 0.16 to 1.42) in the presence of BCNU bubbles. Excitation of BCNU bubbles by resonance frequency-matched FUS (10 MHz) resulted in predominantly stable cavitation and significantly reduced the occurrence of potential hazards of exposure to biological tissues during the BBB opening process. In addition, the drug release process could be monitored by acoustic emission obtained from ultrasound imaging. In tumor-bearing animals, BCNU bubbles with FUS showed significant control of tumor progression and improved maximum survival from 26 to 35 days. This study provides useful advancements toward the goal of successfully translating FUS theranostic bubble-enhanced brain drug delivery into clinical use.},

Ultrasound excitation of microbubbles that were targeted to the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells generated spatially and temporally controlled membrane disruption with high repeatability. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with fluorescence microscopy, we obtained time-resolved measurements of single-cell sonoporation and quantified the size and resealing rate of pores. We measured the intracellular diffusion coefficient of cytoplasmic RNA/DNA from sonoporation-induced transport of an intercalating fluorescent dye into and within single cells. We achieved spatiotemporally controlled delivery with subcellular precision and calcium signaling in targeted cells by selective excitation of microbubbles. Finally, we utilized sonoporation to deliver calcein, a membrane-impermeant substrate of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1), into HEK-MRP1 cells, which overexpress MRP1, and monitored the calcein efflux by MRP1. This approach made it possible to measure the efflux rate in individual cells and to compare it directly to the efflux rate in parental control cells that do not express MRP1.},

Therefore, the acoustic pressure level necessary to generate bubbles in a targeted zone and their exact location are currently difficult to predict. To monitor the initiation of cavitation activity, a novel all-ultrasound technique sensitive to single nucleation events is presented here. It is based on combined passive detection and ultrafast active imaging over a large volume using the same multi-element probe. Bubble nucleation was induced using a focused transducer (660 kHz, f-number = 1) driven by a high-power electric burst (up to 300 W) of one to two cycles. Detection was performed with a linear array (4 to 7 MHz) aligned with the single-element focal point. In vitro experiments in gelatin gel and muscular tissue are presented. The synchronized passive detection enabled radio-frequency data to be recorded, comprising high-frequency coherent wave fronts as signatures of the acoustic emissions linked to the activation of the nuclei. Active change detection images were obtained by subtracting echoes collected in the unnucleated medium. These indicated the appearance of stable cavitating regions. Because of the ultrafast frame rate, active detection occurred as quickly as 330 μs after the high-amplitude excitation and the dynamics of the induced regions were studied individually.},

In this paper, results of experiments and simulations are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of passive cavitation imaging using pulsed ultrasound insonations and how the images depend on pulsed ultrasound parameters. The passive cavitation images were formed from channel data that was beamformed in the frequency domain. Experiments were performed in an invitro flow phantom with an experimental echo contrast agent, echogenic liposomes, as cavitation nuclei. It was found that the pulse duration and envelope have minimal impact on the image resolution achieved. The passive cavitation image amplitude scales linearly with the cavitation emission energy. Cavitation images for both stable and inertial cavitation can be obtained from the same received data set.},

Current optogenetic approaches require invasive surgical procedures to deliver light of specific wavelengths to target cells to activate or silence them. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-pressure ultrasound as a non-invasive trigger to activate specific ultrasonically sensitized neurons in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We first show that wild-type animals are insensitive to low-pressure ultrasound and require gas-filled microbubbles to transduce the ultrasound wave. We find that neuron-specific misexpression of TRP-4, the pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel, sensitizes neurons to ultrasound stimulus, resulting in behavioural outputs. Furthermore, we use this approach to manipulate the function of sensory neurons and interneurons and identify a role for PVD sensory neurons in modifying locomotory behaviours. We suggest that this method can be broadly applied to manipulate cellular functions in vivo.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate feasibility of monitoring high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment with passive acoustic mapping of broadband and harmonic emissions reconstructed from filtered-channel radiofrequency data in ex vivo bovine tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both passive acoustic emissions and B-mode images were recorded with a diagnostic ultrasound machine during 180 HIFU exposures of five freshly excised, degassed bovine livers. Tissue was exposed to peak rarefactional pressures between 3.6 and 8.0 MPa for 2, 5, or 10 seconds. The B-mode images were analyzed for hyperechoic activity, and threshold levels were determined for the harmonic (1.17 mJ) and broadband (0.0137 mJ) components of the passively reconstructed source energy to predict tissue ablation. Both imaging methods were compared with tissue lesions after exposure to determine their spatial accuracy and their capability to help predict presence of ablated tissue. Performance of both methods as detectors was compared (matched-pair test design).
RESULTS: Passive mapping successfully aided prediction of the presence of tissue ablation more often than did conventional hyperechoic images (49 of 58 [84\%] vs 31 of 58 [53\%], P {\textless} .001). At 5.4-6.3-MPa exposures, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the two methods, respectively, were 15 of 20 versus five of 21 (P = .006), eight of nine versus eight of nine (P = .72), 15 of 16 versus five of six (P = .53), and eight of 13 versus eight of 24 (P = .011). Across HIFU exposure amplitude ranges, passive acoustic mapping also aided correct prediction of the visually detected location of ablation following tissue sectioning in 42 of 45 exposures for which the harmonic and broadband threshold levels for tissue ablation were exceeded. Early cavitation activity indicated the focal position within the tissue before irreversible tissue damage occurred.
CONCLUSION: Passive acoustic mapping significantly outperformed the conventional hyperecho technique as an ultrasound-based HIFU monitoring method, as both a detector of lesion occurrence and a method of mapping the position of ablated tissue.},

However, there is less consensus on the biophysical and biological mechanisms leading to this enhanced delivery. Sonoporation, i.e. the formation of temporary pores in the cell membrane, as well as enhanced endocytosis is reported. Because of the variety of ultrasound settings used and corresponding microbubble behavior, a clear overview is missing. Therefore, in this review, the mechanisms contributing to sonoporation are categorized according to three ultrasound settings: i) low intensity ultrasound leading to stable cavitation of microbubbles, ii) high intensity ultrasound leading to inertial cavitation with microbubble collapse, and iii) ultrasound application in the absence of microbubbles. Using low intensity ultrasound, the endocytotic uptake of several drugs could be stimulated, while short but intense ultrasound pulses can be applied to induce pore formation and the direct cytoplasmic uptake of drugs. Ultrasound intensities may be adapted to create pore sizes correlating with drug size. Small molecules are able to diffuse passively through small pores created by low intensity ultrasound treatment. However, delivery of larger drugs such as nanoparticles and gene complexes, will require higher ultrasound intensities in order to allow direct cytoplasmic entry.},

Work in small animals has shown that ultrasound combined with an intravenously circulating microbubble agent can temporarily permeabilize the BBB. Here, we evaluated whether this targeted drug delivery method can be applied safely, reliably, and in a controlled manner on rhesus macaques using a focused ultrasound system. We identified a clear safety window during which BBB disruption could be produced without evident tissue damage, and the acoustic pressure amplitude where the probability for BBB disruption was 50\% and was found to be half of the value that would produce tissue damage. Acoustic emission measurements seem promising for predicting BBB disruption and damage. In addition, we conducted repeated BBB disruption to central visual field targets over several weeks in animals trained to conduct complex visual acuity tasks. All animals recovered from each session without behavioral deficits, visual deficits, or loss in visual acuity. Together, our findings show that BBB disruption can be reliably and repeatedly produced without evident histologic or functional damage in a clinically relevant animal model using a clinical device. These results therefore support clinical testing of this noninvasive-targeted drug delivery method.},

However, current technology lacks the ability to spatially monitor the interaction of the microbubbles with the applied acoustic field, something which is critical for safe clinical translation of these treatments. Passive acoustic mapping could offer a means for spatially monitoring microbubble emissions that relate to bubble activity and associated bioeffects. In this study, a hemispherical receiver array was integrated within an existing transcranial therapy array to create a device capable of both delivering therapy and monitoring the process via passive imaging of bubble clouds. A 128-element receiver array was constructed and characterized for varying bubble concentrations and source spacings. Initial in vivo feasibility testing was performed. The system was found to be capable of monitoring bubble emissions down to single bubble events through an ex vivo human skull. The lateral resolution of the system was found to be between 1.25 and 2 mm and the axial resolution between 2 and 3.5 mm, comparable to the resolution of MRI-based temperature monitoring during thermal FUS treatments in the brain. The results of initial in vivo experiments show that bubble activity can be mapped starting at pressure levels below the threshold for blood-brain barrier disruption. This study presents a feasible solution for imaging bubble activity during cavitation-mediated FUS treatments in the brain.},

To address this limitation, we have identified a mechanically sensitive Piezo1 ion channel (mechanosensor) that is activatable by ultrasound stimulation and integrated it with engineered genetic circuits (genetic transducer) in live HEK293T cells to convert the ultrasound-activated Piezo1 into transcriptional activities. We have further engineered the Jurkat T-cell line and primary T cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to remotely sense the ultrasound wave and transduce it into transcriptional activation for the CAR expression to recognize and eradicate target tumor cells. This approach is modular and can be extended for remote-controlled activation of different cell types with high spatiotemporal precision for therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {Real-time dynamic monitoring of cavitation is essential for the safety and efficiency of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been proposed as a tool of monitoring HIFU therapy. Compared with standard B-mode imaging, PAM has the better detection sensitivity of cavitation. The performance of PAM algorithm is important for localization of cavitation and prediction of bubble-induced lesion. But the quality of cavitation images is hindered by poor resolution and interference of the conventional used PAM. In the present study, a unique PAM algorithm that combines frequency-sum beamforming with robust Capon beamformer (RCB) has been proposed to improve the image quality. The image resolution was improved by higher frequency information manufactured by a quadratic product of cavitation field, and the artifacts were suppressed by using RCB to reject interference among cavitation sources. The method was validated by simulations and in vitro experiments. The results suggested that the modified PAM can realize cavitation mapping with high spatial resolution and greatly reduced artifacts. Further improvements might be achieved with optimized fast imaging algorithm.},

Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been proposed as a tool for true real-time monitoring of HIFU therapy. However, the most-used PAM algorithm based on time exposure acoustic (TEA) limits the quality of cavitation image. Recently, robust Capon beamformer (RCB) has been used in PAM to provide improved resolution and reduced artifacts over TEA-based PAM, but the presented results have not been satisfactory. In the present study, we applied an eigenspace-based RCB (EISRCB) method to further improve the PAM image quality. The optimal weighting vector of the proposed method was found by projecting the RCB weighting vector onto the desired vector subspace constructed from the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix. The performance of the proposed PAM was validated by both simulations and in vitro histotripsy experiments. The results suggested that the proposed PAM significantly outperformed the conventionally used TEA and RCB-based PAM. The comparison results between pulse-echo images of the residual bubbles and cavitation images showed the potential of our proposed PAM in accurate localization of cavitation activity during HIFU therapy.},

Its approximation, which is more suitable for numerical implementation, is used. An error study is carried out to test the efficiency of the model by comparing the results with the Fubini solution. It is shown that the error grows as the propagation distance and step-size increase. However, for the specific case tested, even at a step size as large as one wavelength, sufficient accuracy for plane-wave propagation is observed. A two-dimensional steered transducer problem is explored to verify the nonlinear acoustic field directional independence of the model. A three-dimensional single-element transducer problem is solved to verify the forward model by comparing it with an existing nonlinear wave propagation code.

The basic technique of the integral transform method is demonstrated. Especially, in the case of the time-harmonic response for the 1 and 2D wave equations, the integration path for the inversion integral is discussed in detail with use of the results in Sect. 1.3. At the end of the chapter, the obtained Green's functions are listed in a table so that the reader can easily find the difference of the functional form among the Green's functions. An evaluation technique for a singular inversion integral which arises in a 2D static problem of Laplace equation is also developed.},

In this paper, the angular spectrum method is extended to calculate ultrasound wave propagation in inhomogeneous tissue geometries, important for clinical efficacy, patient safety, and treatment reliability in MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery. The inhomogeneous tissue region to be modeled is segmented into voxels, each voxel having a unique speed of sound, attenuation coefficient, and density. The pressure pattern in the 3-D model is calculated by alternating between the space domain and the spatial-frequency domain for each plane of voxels in the model. The new technique was compared with the finite-difference time-domain technique for a model containing attenuation, refraction, and reflection and for a segmented human breast model; although yielding essentially the same pattern, it results in a reduction in calculation times of at least two orders of magnitude.},

The present method is based on solving an integral equation derived from a Westervelt-like equation. One-dimensional problems are first studied to verify the MDM and to reveal its limitations. It is shown that this method is accurate for cases with small variation of sound speed. A twodimensional case is further studied with focused ultrasound beams to validate the application of the method in the medical field. Results from the MATLAB toolbox k-Wave are used as the benchmark. Normalized root-mean-square (RMS) error estimated at the focus of the transducer is 0.0133 when the coarsest mesh (1/3 of the wavelength) is used in the MDM. Fundamental and second-harmonic fields throughout the considered computational domains are compared and good agreement is observed. In overall, this study demonstrates that the MDM is a computationally efficient and accurate method when used to model wave propagation in biological tissue with relatively weak heterogeneities.},

	abstract = {A novel method for sustaining inertial cavitation during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) exposure in an agar-based tissue-mimicking material is presented. Inertial cavitation occurs during HIFU therapy when the local rarefaction pressure exceeds the inertial cavitation threshold of the insonated medium, and is characterized by broadband acoustic emissions which can be easily detected non-invasively using a passive cavitation detector (PCD). Under the right conditions, inertial cavitation has been previously shown to greatly enhance the rate of heat deposition by redistributing part of the energy carried at the fundamental HIFU frequency to higher frequencies, which are more readily absorbed by visco-elastic media such as soft tissue. However, in the absence of any cavitation control, inertial cavitation activity at the focus decays rapidly over a few seconds of exposure because of the combined effects of cavitation nuclei depletion, bubble dissolution, bubble-bubble interactions, increased vapor pressure caused by heating, and focal shielding caused by pre-focal bubble activity. The present work describes the design, validation, and testing of a real-time adaptive controller, with integrated passive localization capabilities, for sustaining inertial cavitation within the focal region of a HIFU transducer by modulation of the HIFU amplitude. Use of the controller in agar gel, originally at room temperature, has enabled therapeutically relevant temperatures in excess of 55°C to be maintained continuously in the focal region for more than 20 s using significantly less acoustic energy than is required to achieve the same temperature rise in the absence of cavitation control.},

To confirm this unexpected result, the authors performed an experiment in a solution of luminol which is known to be a cavitation detector. A 5-cm diameter spherical transducer (1.1 MHz center frequency and 0.6 MHz bandwidth), focused at 197 mm was used. The ratio of the sonoluminescence intensity produced by a single-frequency signal to that produced by a pseudorandom phase-modulated signal increased with the intensity of the applied held and attained a value of nearly 50 for an intensity of 4.6 W cm/sup -2/.},

	abstract = {The ability of ultrasound to produce highly controlled tissue erosion was investigated. This study is motivated by the need to develop a noninvasive procedure to perforate the neonatal atrial septum as the first step in treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. A total of 232 holes were generated in 40 pieces of excised porcine atrial wall by a 788 kHz single-element transducer. The effects of various parameters [e.g., pulse repetition frequency (PRF), pulse duration (PD), and gas content of liquid] on the erosion rate and energy efficiency were explored. An Isppa of 9000 W/cm2, PDs of 3, 6, 12, and 24 cycles; PRFs between 1.34 kHz and 66.7 kHz; and gas saturation of 40–55\% and 79–85\% were used. The results show that very short pulses delivered at certain PRFs could maximize the erosion rate and energy efficiency. We show that well-defined perforations can be precisely located in the atrial wall through the controlled ultrasound tissue erosion (CUTE) process. A preliminary in vivo experiment was conducted on a canine subject, and the atrial septum was perforated using CUTE.},

Inertial cavitation has been previously shown to result in increased heat deposition and to be associated with broadband noise emissions that can be readily monitored using a passive receiver without interference from the main HIFU signal. In the present study, the signals received passively by each of 64 elements on a standard diagnostic array placed coaxially with the HIFU transducer are combined using time exposure acoustics to generate maps of inertially cavitating regions during HIFU exposure of an agar-based tissue-mimicking material. The technique is shown to be effective in localizing single-bubble activity, as well as contiguous and disjoint cavitating regions instigated by creating regions of lower cavitation threshold within the tissue phantom. The cavitation maps obtained experimentally are also found to be in good agreement with computational simulations and theoretical predictions. Unlike B-mode imaging, which requires interleaving with the HIFU pulse, passive array-based mapping of cavitation activity is possible during HIFU exposure. If cavitating regions can be directly correlated to increased tissue damage, this novel cavitation mapping technique could enable real-time HIFU treatment monitoring.},

	abstract = {PurposeTo develop and test a protocol in preparation for a clinical trial on opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging–guided focused ultrasound for the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to brain tumors.Materials and MethodsThe procedures were approved by the institutional animal care committee. A trans–human skull porcine model was designed for the preclinical testing. Wide craniotomies were applied in 11 pigs (weight, approximately 15 kg). A partial human skull was positioned over the animal’s brain. A modified clinical MR imaging–guided focused ultrasound brain system was used with a 3.0-T MR unit. The ultrasound beam was steered during sonications over a 3 × 3 grid at 3-mm spacing. Acoustic power levels of 3–20 W were tested. Bolus injections of microbubbles at 4 μL/kg were tested for each sonication. Levels of BBB opening, hemorrhage, and cavitation signal were measured with MR imaging, histologic examination, and cavitation receivers, respectively. A cavitation safety algorithm was developed on the basis of logistic regression of the measurements and tested to minimize the risk of hemorrhage.ResultsBBB openings of approximately 1 cm3 in volume were visualized with gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging after sonication at an acoustic power of approximately 5 W. Gross examination of histologic specimens helped confirm Evans blue (bound to macromolecule albumin) extravasation, and hematoxylin-eosin staining helped detect only scattered extravasation of red blood cells. In cases where cavitation signals were higher than thresholds, sonications were terminated immediately without causing hemorrhage.ConclusionWith a trans–human skull porcine model, this study demonstrated BBB opening with a 230-kHz system in preparation for a clinical trial.© RSNA, 2016Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

	abstract = {A novel method for sustaining inertial cavitation during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) exposure in an agar-based tissue-mimicking material is presented. Inertial cavitation occurs during HIFU therapy when the local rarefaction pressure exceeds the inertial cavitation threshold of the insonated medium, and is characterized by broadband acoustic emissions which can be easily detected non-invasively using a passive cavitation detector (PCD). Under the right conditions, inertial cavitation has been previously shown to greatly enhance the rate of heat deposition by redistributing part of the energy carried at the fundamental HIFU frequency to higher frequencies, which are more readily absorbed by visco-elastic media such as soft tissue. However, in the absence of any cavitation control, inertial cavitation activity at the focus decays rapidly over a few seconds of exposure because of the combined effects of cavitation nuclei depletion, bubble dissolution, bubble-bubble interactions, increased vapor pressure caused by heating, and focal shielding caused by pre-focal bubble activity. The present work describes the design, validation, and testing of a real-time adaptive controller, with integrated passive localization capabilities, for sustaining inertial cavitation within the focal region of a HIFU transducer by modulation of the HIFU amplitude. Use of the controller in agar gel, originally at room temperature, has enabled therapeutically relevant temperatures in excess of 55°C to be maintained continuously in the focal region for more than 20 s using significantly less acoustic energy than is required to achieve the same temperature rise in the absence of cavitation control.},

	abstract = {In the aim of limiting the destructive effects of collapsing bubbles, the regime of stable cavitation activity is currently targeted for sensitive therapeutic applications such as blood-brain barrier opening by ultrasound. This activity is quantified through the emergence of the subharmonic component of the fundamental frequency. Due to the intrinsically stochastic behavior of the cavitation phenomenon, a better control of the different (stable or inertial) cavitation regimes is a key requirement in the understanding of the mechanisms involving each bubble-induced mechanical effect. Current strategies applied to stable cavitation control rely on the use of either seeded microbubbles or a long-lasting pulse to reinitiate subharmonic emission. The present work aims at developing an ultrafast (inferior to 250 μs) monitoring and control of subharmonic emissions during long-pulsed (50 ms) sonication. The use of a FPGA-based feedback loop provides reproducible level of subharmonic emissions combined with temporal stability during the sonication duration. In addition, stable cavitation events are differentiated from the broadband noise characterizing inertial cavitation activity, with perspectives in the discrimination of the involved mechanisms underlying bubble-mediated therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of transcranial passive acoustic mapping with hemispherical sparse arrays (30 cm diameter, 16 to 1372 elements, 2.48 mm receiver diameter) using CT-based aberration corrections was investigated via numerical simulations. A multi-layered ray acoustic transcranial ultrasound propagation model based on CT-derived skull morphology was developed. By incorporating skull-specific aberration corrections into a conventional passive beamforming algorithm (Norton and Won 2000 IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens. 38 1337–43), simulated acoustic source fields representing the emissions from acoustically-stimulated microbubbles were spatially mapped through three digitized human skulls, with the transskull reconstructions closely matching the water-path control images. Image quality was quantified based on main lobe beamwidths, peak sidelobe ratio, and image signal-to-noise ratio. The effects on the resulting image quality of the source’s emission frequency and location within the skull cavity, the array sparsity and element configuration, the receiver element sensitivity, and the specific skull morphology were all investigated. The system’s resolution capabilities were also estimated for various degrees of array sparsity. Passive imaging of acoustic sources through an intact skull was shown possible with sparse hemispherical imaging arrays. This technique may be useful for the monitoring and control of transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) treatments, particularly non-thermal, cavitation-mediated applications such as FUS-induced blood–brain barrier disruption or sonothrombolysis, for which no real-time monitoring techniques currently exist.},

However, the inherently non-linear microbubble oscillations combined with the micrometer and microsecond scales involved in these interactions and the limited methods to assess and visualize them transcranially hinder both their optimal use and translation to the clinics. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework that combines numerical simulations with multimodality imaging to assess and visualize the microbubble oscillations transcranially. In the present work, microbubble oscillations were studied with an integrated US and MR imaging guided clinical FUS system. A high-resolution brain CT scan was also co-registered to the US and MR images and the derived acoustic properties were used as inputs to two- and three-dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain simulations that matched the experimental conditions and geometry. Synthetic point sources by either a Gaussian function or the output of a microbubble dynamics model were numerically excited and propagated through the skull towards a virtual US imaging array. Using passive acoustic mapping (PAM) that was refined to incorporate variable speed of sound, we were able to correct the aberrations introduced by the skull and substantially improve the PAM resolution. The good agreement between the simulations incorporating microbubble emissions and experimentally-determined PAMs suggest that this integrated approach can provide a clinically-relevant framework and more control over this nonlinear and dynamic process.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in bubble-mediated focused ultrasound (FUS) interventions in the brain. However, current technology lacks the ability to spatially monitor the interaction of the microbubbles with the applied acoustic field, something which is critical for safe clinical translation of these treatments. Passive acoustic mapping could offer a means for spatially monitoring microbubble emissions that relate to bubble activity and associated bioeffects. In this study a hemispherical receiver array was integrated within an existing transcranial therapy array to create a device capable of both delivering therapy and monitoring the process via passive imaging of bubble clouds. A 128-element receiver array was constructed and characterized for varying bubble concentrations and source spacings. Initial in vivo feasibility testing was performed. The system was found to be capable of monitoring bubble emissions down to single bubble events through an ex vivo human skull. The lateral resolution of the system was found to be between 1.25-2 mm and the axial resolution between 2-3.5 mm, comparable to the resolution of MRI-based temperature monitoring during thermal FUS treatments in the brain. The results of initial in vivo experiments show that bubble activity can be mapped starting at pressure levels below the threshold for Blood-Brain barrier disruption. This study presents a feasible solution for imaging bubble activity during cavitation-mediated FUS treatments in the brain.},

	abstract = {A new, freely available third party MATLAB toolbox for the simulation and reconstruction of photoacoustic wave fields is described. The toolbox, named k-Wave, is designed to make realistic photoacoustic modeling simple and fast. The forward simulations are based on a k-space pseudo-spectral time domain solution to coupled first-order acoustic equations for homogeneous or heterogeneous media in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulation functions can additionally be used as a flexible time reversal image reconstruction algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped measurement surface. A one-step image reconstruction algorithm for a planar detector geometry based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is also included. The architecture and use of the toolbox are described, and several novel modeling examples are given. First, the use of data interpolation is shown to considerably improve time reversal reconstructions when the measurement surface has only a sparse array of detector points. Second, by comparison with one-step, FFT-based reconstruction, time reversal is shown to be sufficiently general that it can also be used for finite-sized planar measurement surfaces. Last, the optimization of computational speed is demonstrated through parallel execution using a graphics processing unit.},

However, the technique has potential use as a feedback mechanism for pulsed-wave therapies, such as ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. In this paper, results of experiments and simulations are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of passive cavitation imaging using pulsed ultrasound insonations and how the images depend on pulsed ultrasound parameters. The passive cavitation images were formed from channel data that was beamformed in the frequency domain. Experiments were performed in an invitro flow phantom with an experimental echo contrast agent, echogenic liposomes, as cavitation nuclei. It was found that the pulse duration and envelope have minimal impact on the image resolution achieved. The passive cavitation image amplitude scales linearly with the cavitation emission energy. Cavitation images for both stable and inertial cavitation can be obtained from the same received data set.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for passive imaging of cavitational acoustic emissions using an ultrasound array, with potential application in real-time monitoring of ultrasound ablation. To create such images, microbubble emissions were passively sensed by an imaging array and dynamically focused at multiple depths. In this paper, an analytic expression for a passive image is obtained by solving the Rayleigh-Sommerfield integral, under the Fresnel approximation, and passive images were simulated. A 192-element array was used to create passive images, in real time, from 520-kHz ultrasound scattered by a 1-mm steel wire. Azimuthal positions of this target were accurately estimated from the passive images. Next, stable and inertial cavitation was passively imaged in saline solution sonicated at 520 kHz. Bubble clusters formed in the saline samples were consistently located on both passive images and B-scans. Passive images were also created using broadband emissions from bovine liver sonicated at 2.2 MHz. Agreement was found between the images and source beam shape, indicating an ability to map therapeutic ultrasound beams in situ. The relation between these broadband emissions, sonication amplitude, and exposure conditions are discussed.},

A passive beamforming method is presented that provides greatly improved spatial accuracy over the conventionally used time exposure acoustics (TEA) PAM reconstruction algorithm. Both the Capon beamformer and the robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for PAM are suggested as methods to reduce interference artifacts and improve resolution, which has been one of the experimental issues previously observed with TEA. Simulation results that replicate the experimental artifacts are shown to suggest that bubble interactions are the chief cause. Analysis is provided to show that these multiple bubble artifacts are generally not reduced by TEA, while Capon-based methods are able to reduce the artifacts. This is followed by experimental results from in vitro experiments and in vivo oncolytic viral therapy trials that show improved results in PAM, where RCB is able to more accurately localize the acoustic activity than TEA.},

	abstract = {Sources of nonlinear acoustic emissions, particularly those associated with cavitation activity, play a key role in the safety and efficacy of current and emerging therapeutic ultrasound applications, such as oncological drug delivery, blood-brain barrier opening and histotripsy. Passive Acoustic Mapping (PAM) is the first technique to enable real-time and non-invasive imaging of cavitation activity during therapeutic ultrasound exposure, through the recording and passive beamforming of broadband acoustic emissions using an array of ultrasound detectors. Initial limitations in PAM spatial resolution led to the adoption of optimal data-adaptive beamforming algorithms, such as the Robust Capon Beamformer (RCB), that provide improved interference suppression and calibration error mitigation compared to non-adaptive beamformers. However, such approaches are restricted by the assumption that the recorded signals have a Gaussian distribution. To overcome this limitation and further improve the source resolvability of PAM, we propose a new beamforming approach termed Robust Beamforming by Linear Programming (RLPB). Along with the variance, this optimization-based method uses higher-order-statistics of the recorded signals, making no prior assumption on the statistical distribution of the acoustic signals. RLPB is found via numerical simulations to improve resolvability over TEA and RCB. In vitro experimentation yielded improved resolvability with respect to the source-to-array distance on the order of 22\% axially and 13\% transversely relative to RCB, whilst successfully accounting for array calibration errors. The improved resolution and decreased dependence on accurate calibration of RLPB is expected to facilitate the clinical translation of PAM for diagnostic, including super-resolution, and therapeutic ultrasound applications.},
